# Philia – Decentralized Messaging + Micro-Finance
Philia is where encrypted messaging meets borderless finance, designed for the 1.7 billion unbanked.

**Philia** is an open-source application that combines:  
- 🟢 secure, federated messaging from [Matrix](https://matrix.org)  
- 🟡 an integrated wallet for payments in **Stellar Lumens (XLM)**  
- 🌍 an inclusive vision to support those who are currently *unbanked*

## 🌟 Goal  
A simple, lightweight app. A global mission. Built with privacy, dignity, and financial justice in mind.
To create a P2P app that enables:  
- Secure communication without centralized servers  
- Real-time sending and receiving of money, in any currency  
- A first step towards an ethical, accessible **decentralized bank**

## 🧪 Project Status  
Early stage (early prototype). Fork of Element + initial tests on Stellar wallet.
- ✅ Fork of Element Android started
- 🔄 Initial integration of Stellar wallet in testing
- 🧪 MVP goal: technical demo + showcase website 

 We welcome contributors of all levels. Let’s build something meaningful together.
