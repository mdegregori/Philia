# Philia – Decentralized Messaging + Micro-Finance

**Philia** is an open-source application that combines:  
- 🟢 secure, federated messaging from [Matrix](https://matrix.org)  
- 🟡 an integrated wallet for payments in **Stellar Lumens (XLM)**  
- 🌍 an inclusive vision to support those who are currently *unbanked*

## 🌟 Goal  
To create a P2P app that enables:  
- Secure communication without centralized servers  
- Real-time sending and receiving of money, in any currency  
- A first step towards an ethical, accessible **decentralized bank**

## 🧪 Project Status  
Early stage (early prototype). Fork of Element + initial tests on Stellar wallet.

👋 Looking for developers, designers, and decentralization enthusiasts.
